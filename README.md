# Migration Bias Filter
## A text-replacement browser extension

This extension replaces words such as "immigrant" with more neutral language such as "expat", as is typically applied to domestic citizens abroad.

The aim being to highlight the linguistic double standard where similar situations are described differently based on where the person is from.
